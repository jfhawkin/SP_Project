# SP_Project
This is an SP survey generator developed for a survey of household electricity preferences. The idea was to consider preferences for
various forms of electricity generation by their distance to the home. This would be used in a supply/demand model based on a standard
disaggregate mode choice model. Residents would pick a preferred generation source and majority rule would be used for each zone to allocate
a plant. There is also some skeleton code for the demand model (written in Python).
